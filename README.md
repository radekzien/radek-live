# My Portfolio Website
Welcome to the repository for my portfolio website.
This is a frontend-only project built to keep things simple and focused. There's no backend involved, as all the required functionality is handled on the client side.
This project was made with
  - Next.js for the framework
  - TailwindCSS for inline UI design
  - React-Icons and Lucide Icons for sleek and consistent SVG icons
  - FormCarry for the form backend handling Email submissions
  - Vercel for deployment and hosting.

The aim of this website is to show off my design skills and creativity, and create an all-in-one place online to view my achievements. A simple devlog for this project can be found in DEVLOG.md in the root of this repo
